### Computational Methods & Numerical Analysis Project  
**GitHub Repository**: [github.com/Mak1226/Computational_Methods_And_Applications](https://github.com/Mak1226/Computational_Methods_And_Applications)  
**Key Skills**: Finite Difference/Element Methods (FDM/FEM), Monte Carlo Simulation, Numerical Optimization, Spectral Methods, Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, FEniCS  

#### Project Highlights:  
- Implemented **finite difference solvers** for PDEs (1D/2D heat, wave, and Poisson equations) using explicit schemes and five-point stencils.  
- Developed **finite element solvers** (1D/2D) using FEniCS for variational formulations, mesh generation, and visualization.  
- Built **Monte Carlo simulations** for numerical integration and financial option pricing with geometric Brownian motion.  
- Designed optimization algorithms (gradient descent, genetic algorithms) to minimize complex functions like Rosenbrock.  
- Applied **spectral methods** (FFT-based) to solve PDEs with periodic boundary conditions for improved accuracy.  

#### Key Contributions:  
- Structured modular, reusable code for computational methods, enabling easy adaptation to new problems.  
- Integrated visualization tools (`matplotlib`) to analyze results (e.g., heat distribution, option price convergence).  
- Demonstrated cross-disciplinary applications: fluid dynamics (staggered grids), quantitative finance (option pricing).
